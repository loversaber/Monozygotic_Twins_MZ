# monozygotic-twins-MZ-
The mtDNA mutation feature in monozygotic twins (MZ) which have different level of glycometabolism.
 We have 25 paired samples which have different level of glucose metabolism.
 The phenotype: fasting blood glucose (glu0h) and the blood glucose two hours after eating (glu2h).
 What we prepare to do is linking the glycometabolism with the mtDNA mutations.
